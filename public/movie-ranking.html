<h1>Top 3 movies of all time</h1>
<h2>According to Hassan Abbud</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Number 1: A silent voice</h3>
<p>Really good anime movie, talks about a Middle School bully who later learns about the
    wrong in his actions and tries to mend it. It touches on topics such as depression
    friendship and forgivness. Persoally I think is beautiful
</p>

<h3>Number 2: Your name</h3>
<P>From Makoto Shinkai, his most famous work Your Name is a story about a high school 
    boy and girl that exchange bodies mysteriously and they have to figure out how to live 
    each others lifes while keeping their own as it should be. Romantic, dramatic and funny.
    Really good movie.

<h3>Number 3: Adventures of TinTin</h3>
<p>Great movie all around, especially the comic parts. It has a good premise and gives
    thrills and funny moments to the viewer throughout the movie.
